fs-gui
======

A simple php file system manager. Easy to install, simplistic codebase. Just drop into any folder and it's ready to go. You can also define any folder you would like to manage.

A great "rescue" tool if you can't edit files remotely on your server for some reason.

Supports creating, deleting and moving files across multiple directories. Comes with both a plain-text editor and an HTML editor for writing files.

Built with jquery.

Like 90% of small projects on github, I make no claims that this project is secure.
